THIS IS MY CONFIGURATION FOR ARCH!
I MADE SOME BASH FILES THAT WILL ALLOW ME
TO MAKE C AND C++ PROJECTS EASILY. I HAVE REUSED MY CODE
FROM MY GEANY CONFIG AT : https://github.com/VladArambasa/geany-config
THIS IS USED TO MAKE MY UBUNTU GEANY WORK AS A COMPILER OF SORTS.

GEANY CONFIG HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED AND USED BY MY STUDENTS.
                            I HATE GIT
ANYWAY,
THE REUSED FILES ARE:
    
    compile.sh
    
    build.sh


I HAVE CREATED A NEW FILE, mkproj.sh THAT WILL:   

    1. COPY: master.h FROM THE FOLDER utils/ (U CAN CHANGE IT)

    2. COPY: main.c OR main.cpp FROM THE FOLDER utils/ (U CAN CHANGE IT)

    3. COPY: compile.sh AND build.sh FROM THE FOLDER utils/ (U CAN CHANGE IT)

    4. COPY: run.sh FROM THE FOLDER utils/ (U CAN CHANGE IT)

    5. COPY: cbr.sh FROM THE FOLDER utils/ (U CAN CHANGE IT)


cbr.sh - COMPILE -> BUILD -> RUN

run.sh - RUNS PROGRAM


THE COMPILE FILE CLONES YOUR FOLDER STRUCTURE. IN THE MIRRORED/CLONED FOLDERS, THEY ADD THE .o FILES (SAY math.c IS IN SUBFOLDER src/, THEN math.o WILL BE IN ./build/src)

THE BUILD FILE LINKS EVERYTHING AND CREATES THE SUBFOLDER release/ AND IN RELEASE YOU WILL HAVE THE program FILE YOU CAN RUN VIA ./program IF YOU'RE cd-ED IN THAT FOLDER OR BY USING ./release/program IF YOU ARE IN THE PROJECT FOLDER.
ALTERNITIVELY, YOU CAN TYPE ./run.sh OR ./cbr.sh IF YOU'RE IN THE PROJECT FOLDER

THE PROGRAM ONLY COPIES THE FILES IF THEY DON'T EXIST (THE COMMAND MKPROJ)

USAGE: mkproj -c | -cpp

IT DOES ITS MAGIC IN THE LOCAL FOLDER (DUH).

IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SETUP, KINDLY SOD OFF :D
